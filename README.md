# Readable Project

This project was developed as part of the Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The app show a list of posts that can be filtered by their category and sorted by their vote score, creation date or number of comments. You can add new posts by clicking on the floating button on the bottom right corner of the screen.
On the post page, you can see all the comments and add a new one. You can also sort the comments, edit their content or delete then.

**IMPORTANT: Because there is no authentication, everyone can create, edit and delete all the posts and comments.**
